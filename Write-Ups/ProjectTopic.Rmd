## I. Literature review

We expect the literature review will be around 5 well-cited paragraphs that do the following:

1. Introduce the problem and explain why
- Set the stage for the problem
- Put the concept and question into context
- Lots of big-picture citations (such as reviews) in the first paragraph

2. Past work and data available
  Similar questions have been raised and answered in different regions around North America. In Vermont, USA, it was found that greater species diversity was correlated with grasslands and lower was correlated with deciduous and mixed forest cover (Richardson et al., 2019). In Southeastern United States, pine forests and extensive wetlands correlated negatively with bee richness, while open canopies correlated positively (Ulyshen et al., 2024). Our project looks to answer similar questions, specifically exploring Oregon. In addition to the dataset from OBA, we will be using the National Land Cover Database (NLCB), which is a dataset that provides land cover information across the country. 
  
3. Purpose of the study
- Further refine your approach (e.g., what data will you combine, how will you address the question)
- Justify why this is needed now (e.g., visualization to test a new dimension of the question or better convey an old one)
 

4. Hypotheses/questions
- List these clearly and in a logical order
- Make hypotheses directionally using predictions (e.g. “I predict urbanization will reduce plant diversity” rather than “I predict urbanization will change plant diversity”)
